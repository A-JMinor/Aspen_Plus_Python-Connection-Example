# Aspen Plus-Python connection example

This repo contains an Aspen Plus-Python connection example.

Differently from Aspen-HYSYS, accesing the variable paths in Aspen Plus is very straight forward. Therefore, the connection can be made directly easily (without the spreadsheets trick of the [Aspen_HYSYS_Python repo](https://github.com/edgarsmdn/Aspen_HYSYS_Python)).

The code is just a couple of lines long that are self-explanatory and have comments too.

This is an example of where you might want to look for the variable paths of interest:
